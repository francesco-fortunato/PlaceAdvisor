\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

This report provides an overview of the PlaceAdvisor web application, including the design of the system, software architecture, and the project's development process, documented in a booklet. PlaceAdvisor is a platform designed to help users discover points of interest in various cities and locations. After obtaining all the relevant information about a point of interest (address, map, historical background, and more), users can also view reviews from other users and, if desired, contribute their own reviews.
