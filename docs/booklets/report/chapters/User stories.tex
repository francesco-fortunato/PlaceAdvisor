\section{User Stories}\label{sec:userstories}

In this section, we will break down the user requirements into user stories, providing also some mockup crafted with balsamiq. Each user story represents a specific piece of functionality that adds value to our web-application, providing a clear, concise description of what needs to be implemented to better guide the development process. 

\textbf{User Registration:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item As a new user, I want to register inside the web application using my Facebook account in order to access the service.
